# Weekend ?

- Not pretty
- Not enough explanations maybe
- Pretty ok
- Participation trophy 

# Why a database

- To keep structured -> Objects & Arrays
- To make it accessible -> JSON
- Store information -> Fs.write / Fs.read JSON
- Complicated filters done easy -> Helper functions
- Easier to update -> Objects (easy-ish to update)
